    <h2>Tokenomics Basics</h2>
    <p>
      Tokenomics, short for "Token Economics," refers to the study and design of the economic system behind a cryptocurrency or tokenized project. It includes everything from how a token is created, distributed, and used, to how it holds or gains value over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Elements of Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> The maximum number of tokens that will ever exist (e.g., Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million).</li>
      <li><strong>Circulating Supply:</strong> The amount of tokens currently in use and available in the market.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation vs Deflation:</strong> Some tokens increase in supply over time (inflationary), while others are capped or burned (deflationary).</li>
      <li><strong>Utility:</strong> What is the token used for? (e.g., governance, access, payments, staking).</li>
      <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> How tokens are initially distributed — via ICO, airdrop, mining, or staking.</li>
      <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Mechanisms to reward users or participants in the network (e.g., staking rewards, liquidity mining).</li>
      <li><strong>Token Burn:</strong> A process where tokens are intentionally destroyed to reduce supply and potentially increase scarcity and value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Think of tokenomics like designing a new country’s currency system. How much money will be printed? Who gets the money first? Can people earn interest by saving it? Can it be spent for services or voting? All these questions apply to designing token systems too.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Tokenomics Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Well-designed tokenomics ensures a project's sustainability and community growth. Poorly designed tokenomics can lead to inflation, dumping, or loss of user trust.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Fixed supply of 21 million, no inflation — makes it a deflationary asset.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Initially inflationary but now has burning mechanisms (EIP-1559) to reduce supply.</li>
      <li><strong>Shiba Inu:</strong> Huge initial supply with regular token burns to reduce supply and build scarcity.</li>
    </ul>
