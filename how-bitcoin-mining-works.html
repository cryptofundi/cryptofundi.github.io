    <h2>How Bitcoin Mining Works</h2>

    <p>Bitcoin mining is the process through which new bitcoins are created and transactions are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s the backbone of the Bitcoin network and ensures its security and decentralization.</p>

    <h3>🔧 What Does Mining Actually Do?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confirms transactions:</strong> Every 10 minutes, a new block of transactions is confirmed by miners.</li>
      <li><strong>Secures the network:</strong> Miners use computational power to validate transactions and prevent double-spending.</li>
      <li><strong>Creates new Bitcoin:</strong> As a reward, miners earn new bitcoins plus transaction fees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚙️ The Process in Simple Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Transactions are broadcasted to the Bitcoin network.</li>
      <li>Miners group them into a “block.”</li>
      <li>Miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle (called Proof of Work).</li>
      <li>The first miner to solve it broadcasts the solution.</li>
      <li>If accepted by the network, the block is added to the blockchain.</li>
      <li>The winning miner receives a block reward (currently 3.125 BTC as of 2024, halving every 4 years).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Imagine a lottery where thousands of people guess a number every 10 minutes. The first one to guess it right wins a prize (Bitcoin) and gets to record the transactions in the ledger (blockchain). The more powerful your computer, the more guesses you can make per second.</p>

    <h3>🖥️ Equipment Used in Mining</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Used in early days. Too slow for modern mining.</li>
      <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Graphics cards — faster, still used in some altcoins.</li>
      <li><strong>ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits):</strong> Specialized hardware used in serious Bitcoin mining today.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌎 Where Does Mining Happen?</h3>
    <p>Mostly in countries with cheap electricity (like the U.S., Kazakhstan, China in the past). Many mining farms are powered by renewable energy to reduce environmental impact.</p>

    <h3>💰 Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures Bitcoin’s supply is predictable (max 21 million coins).</li>
      <li>Protects against fraud and tampering.</li>
      <li>Provides incentives for individuals to support the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Mining is the heartbeat of Bitcoin — it’s how new coins are born and how the whole system remains secure. Understanding mining gives you insight into why Bitcoin is both powerful and scarce.</p>
