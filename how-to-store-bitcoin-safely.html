    <h2>How to Store Bitcoin Safely</h2>
    <p>
      Storing your Bitcoin safely is one of the most important parts of being your own bank. Unlike traditional money, there‚Äôs no customer support in crypto ‚Äî you are fully responsible for your funds.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Use a Wallet (Not an Exchange)</h3>
    <p>
      Never leave your Bitcoin on an exchange for long periods. Exchanges can get hacked or freeze accounts. Instead, move your Bitcoin to a **crypto wallet** that you control.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Choose Between Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets</h3>
    <p>
      - <strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> These are connected to the internet ‚Äî examples include mobile apps or browser extensions like Xverse, Phantom, Metamask. They are convenient but less secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      - <strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> These are offline ‚Äî like hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger or Trezor). They offer maximum security for long-term storage.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Backup Your Recovery Phrase</h3>
    <p>
      When you create a wallet, you‚Äôll receive a 12‚Äì24 word **recovery phrase**. Write it down on paper and store it somewhere safe. Never share it with anyone. If someone has your recovery phrase, they can take your Bitcoin.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Use Strong Security Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt click suspicious links or apps</li>
      <li>Update your software regularly</li>
      <li>Use a dedicated device for crypto, if possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîê Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Think of your crypto wallet like your personal safe. A hot wallet is like a safe in your house, connected to the internet ‚Äî handy but exposed. A cold wallet is like a vault buried underground ‚Äî harder to reach but nearly impossible to hack.
