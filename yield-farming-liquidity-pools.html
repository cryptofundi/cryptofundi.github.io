    <h2>Yield Farming & Liquidity Pools</h2>

    <p><strong>Yield Farming</strong> is the process of earning rewards or interest by locking up your crypto in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Liquidity Pools</strong> are pools of crypto assets (like ETH + USDC) provided by users to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) so others can trade between them. In return, providers earn a share of the trading fees and other incentives.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Imagine you're lending your gold and silver to a jewelry shop. They use it to make and sell jewelry. In return, they share a cut of their profits with you. That’s yield farming in a nutshell.</p>

    <h3>💧 How Liquidity Pools Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users deposit two tokens (e.g., ETH and DAI) into a pool.</li>
      <li>This allows others to trade between the two tokens on a DEX like Uniswap.</li>
      <li>In return, depositors get Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens.</li>
      <li>They earn fees from every trade made using that pool.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌾 What is Yield Farming?</h3>
    <p>Yield farming goes a step further. You can take your LP tokens and stake them in a yield farm to earn even more tokens, sometimes the platform's native token.</p>

    <h3>🔥 Risks to Know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Impermanent Loss:</strong> Happens when the price of deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Contract Bugs:</strong> Vulnerabilities in the code can be exploited.</li>
      <li><strong>Rug Pulls:</strong> Some platforms can disappear with user funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Popular Platforms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uniswap</strong> (Ethereum, Base)</li>
      <li><strong>PancakeSwap</strong> (BNB Chain)</li>
      <li><strong>Raydium</strong> (Solana)</li>
      <li><strong>Aave</strong> (for lending/borrowing, also considered yield generation)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yield farming and liquidity pools are key innovations in DeFi that allow users to put their crypto to work — but always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before diving in!</p>
