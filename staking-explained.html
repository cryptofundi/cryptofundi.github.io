    <h2>Staking Explained</h2>

    <p><strong>Staking</strong> is the process of locking up your cryptocurrency to help support the operations and security of a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards — like interest for helping the network run smoothly.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Think of staking like putting money in a fixed deposit. You can't access it for a while, but in return, the bank pays you interest. In staking, you're locking your crypto and earning rewards for helping the network operate.</p>

    <h3>🔐 How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blockchains like Ethereum (after the Merge), Cardano, and Solana use a system called Proof of Stake (PoS).</li>
      <li>You “stake” your coins to help validate transactions on the network.</li>
      <li>Validators (computers that process transactions) are chosen based on the amount of crypto staked.</li>
      <li>More stake = higher chance to validate and earn rewards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💰 Types of Staking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solo Staking:</strong> You run your own validator node (requires technical skills and a high minimum stake).</li>
      <li><strong>Staking Pools:</strong> You join others in pooling funds to increase your chances and share the rewards.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange Staking:</strong> Easy option through platforms like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken — but they take a small cut.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🎯 Pros of Staking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Earn passive income</li>
      <li>Support the blockchain’s security and efficiency</li>
      <li>More energy-efficient than mining (especially vs Bitcoin)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Risks of Staking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lock-up Period:</strong> You may not be able to withdraw instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Slashing:</strong> Misbehaving validators may lose a portion of their stake.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform Risk:</strong> Staking through exchanges means trusting them with your crypto.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🪙 Popular Staking Coins</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> – PoS after the Merge</li>
      <li><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Polkadot (DOT)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Tezos (XTZ)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Staking is a great way to earn rewards while participating in the blockchain ecosystem — but it’s important to understand the rules, risks, and rewards before diving in.</p>
