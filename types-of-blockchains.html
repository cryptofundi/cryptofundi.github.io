    <h2>Types of Blockchains</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchains come in different types based on who can access them and how data is controlled. Understanding these helps you know where different blockchain technologies fit in the real world.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Public Blockchains</h3>
    <p>
      These are open to everyone. Anyone can read, write, or participate. Bitcoin and Ethereum are great examples.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Digital currencies, decentralized apps (dApps), NFTs.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like the internet — anyone can access it, contribute, and build on it.</p>

    <h3>2. Private Blockchains</h3>
    <p>
      Access is restricted to a specific group or organization. Only selected members can read or write data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Enterprises using blockchain for internal records, supply chain, or compliance.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like a company intranet — only employees have access.</p>

    <h3>3. Consortium (or Federated) Blockchains</h3>
    <p>
      Controlled by a group of organizations rather than a single entity. It blends features of both public and private chains.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Banking consortia, cross-industry partnerships, shared databases.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like a shared Google Doc — multiple trusted users can edit it.</p>

    <h3>4. Hybrid Blockchains</h3>
    <p>
      A mix of public and private blockchains, giving organizations control over what is public and what stays private.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Governments, healthcare, real estate, or where sensitive data must be partially restricted.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like a smart building — public entrance, but private rooms with access control.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public:</strong> Open to all</li>
      <li><strong>Private:</strong> Restricted to one organization</li>
      <li><strong>Consortium:</strong> Controlled by a group</li>
      <li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Mix of public & private control</li>
    </ul>
