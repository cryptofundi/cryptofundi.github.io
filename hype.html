<h1>Hyperliquid: A Next-Gen Perpetual DEX</h1>

  <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
  <p>Hyperliquid is a fully on-chain perpetuals exchange (DEX) focused on ultra-fast transaction speeds, deep liquidity, and a seamless user experience. It aims to provide the functionality of centralized exchanges with the transparency and self-custody of decentralized platforms.</p>

  <h2>2. Core Technology & Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom-built L1 blockchain optimized for trading</li>
    <li>Instant order execution with sub-second finality</li>
    <li>Zero gas fees for users</li>
    <li>Innovative matching engine and isolated margin per market</li>
    <li>Trustless on-chain order book</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Tokenomics</h2>
  <p>As of now, Hyperliquid does not have a public token. However, there is ongoing speculation that a token launch and airdrop could happen in the future based on community contributions and trading activity.</p>

  <h2>4. Team & Backers</h2>
  <p>The team behind Hyperliquid remains pseudonymous. Despite the anonymity, their consistent product improvements and rapidly growing user base have instilled strong trust in the crypto community. They have not announced any VC backing, aligning with their community-first vision.</p>

  <h2>5. Ecosystem & Use Cases</h2>
  <p>Hyperliquid is designed exclusively for perpetual futures trading. It supports a wide range of crypto pairs and offers unique features like public performance leaderboards, strategy vaults, and in-depth analytics to empower traders.</p>

  <h2>6. Market Performance</h2>
  <p>Hyperliquid has grown rapidly in 2024‚Äì2025, with trading volumes often competing with established perpetual DEXs like dYdX and GMX. It has seen impressive organic growth driven by its product quality and viral community engagement.</p>

  <h2>7. Roadmap & Recent Developments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Launched Isolated Margin functionality</li>
    <li>Expanded asset support including memecoins</li>
    <li>Introduced copy trading and strategy vaults</li>
    <li>Rumored token airdrop campaign in progress</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. How to Trade and Store</h2>
  <p>Hyperliquid operates via its web app at <a href="https://app.hyperliquid.xyz">app.hyperliquid.xyz</a>. Traders can connect via MetaMask or WalletConnect-compatible wallets. There is no native token yet to store, but user account balances remain secure in smart contracts on-chain.</p>

  
  <h2>9. Risks and Criticisms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Still lacks a native token which some view as a missing incentive layer</li>
    <li>Pseudonymous team may be seen as a red flag for some institutional traders</li>
    <li>No audits published yet, though the platform has been battle-tested</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Hyperliquid is an impressive example of how a focused, product-first approach can disrupt the perpetual DEX landscape. With cutting-edge performance, trader-focused features, and a viral community, it‚Äôs definitely one to watch‚Äîespecially if a token launch is on the horizon.</p>
