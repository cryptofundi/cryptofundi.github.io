    <h2>Bittensor (TAO) - Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>1. 🔍 Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Bittensor is a decentralized network that incentivizes machine learning models to share knowledge. It creates a peer-to-peer intelligence market, allowing AI models to collaborate, compete, and earn rewards in TAO tokens based on the quality and utility of their outputs.</p>

    <h3>2. ⚙️ Core Technology & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decentralized AI:</strong> Models run on a globally distributed network and are not owned by centralized entities</li>
      <li><strong>Incentive Layer:</strong> TAO tokens are used to reward models contributing valuable outputs</li>
      <li><strong>Subnets:</strong> Each AI subnet specializes in a different task (e.g., NLP, image generation)</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain-Powered:</strong> Built on its own substrate-based chain with PoS mechanics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. 📊 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ticker:</strong> TAO</li>
      <li><strong>Max Supply:</strong> 21 million TAO (Bitcoin-inspired cap)</li>
      <li><strong>Emission:</strong> Halving model every 4 years</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Model staking, governance, transaction fees, incentives for AI contributors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. 👥 Team & Backers</h3>
    <p>Bittensor was founded by Ala Shaabana and Jacob Steeves (former Google AI). It has gained support from prominent researchers and developers in the AI and crypto spaces. The project is community-driven and increasingly decentralized.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌐 Ecosystem & Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decentralized AI Marketplaces:</strong> Contributors compete to provide the best AI outputs</li>
      <li><strong>Open Model Training:</strong> Models learn from each other rather than from centralized datasets</li>
      <li><strong>DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure):</strong> Aligns with broader DePIN narratives by distributing compute</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. 📈 Market Performance</h3>
    <p>TAO has shown strong growth and interest due to the hype around decentralized AI. Despite being early-stage, it's one of the leading AI-native cryptocurrencies, with a limited supply and strong narrative momentum.</p>

    <h3>7. 🛣️ Roadmap & Recent Developments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subnet Expansion:</strong> Growth in active subnets for different AI tasks (text, images, voice, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Lightweight Mining:</strong> Lower barrier for model contributors</li>
      <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Plans to connect with other decentralized compute and AI ecosystems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. 🛒 How to Buy & Store TAO</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy:</strong> Available on MEXC, Gate.io, and DEXs like Taobridge or via OTC</li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> TAO Wallet (via CLI), Polkadot-based wallets, Subtensor-native options</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. ⚠️ Risks & Criticisms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Early-stage ecosystem with technical complexity</li>
      <li>Limited accessibility for non-technical users and contributors</li>
      <li>Centralization concerns around initial subnet operators and token distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. 🧠 Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Bittensor represents a bold vision to decentralize artificial intelligence. With a strong tokenomics model, capped supply, and rising relevance in the AI era, TAO is emerging as a key player for those who believe in open-source AI. However, the tech is complex, and adoption will depend on education and tooling improvements.</p>
