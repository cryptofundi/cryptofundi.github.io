    <h2>Avalanche (AVAX) - Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>1. 🔍 Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Avalanche is a highly scalable Layer 1 blockchain platform launched in September 2020 by Ava Labs. It aims to deliver fast, low-cost transactions while supporting a wide range of custom blockchain deployments. Avalanche is particularly known for its subnet architecture, allowing for flexible, interoperable networks.</p>

    <h3>2. ⚙️ Core Technology & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snowman Consensus:</strong> A novel consensus mechanism that enables near-instant finality with high throughput.</li>
      <li><strong>Subnet Architecture:</strong> Developers can create custom blockchains (subnets) tailored to their needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Tri-Chain Design:</strong> X-Chain (asset transfers), C-Chain (smart contracts, EVM-compatible), and P-Chain (staking & validators).</li>
      <li><strong>Fast Finality:</strong> Transactions finalize in under 2 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. 📊 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ticker:</strong> AVAX</li>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> Capped at 720 million AVAX</li>
      <li><strong>Staking Rewards:</strong> Validators and delegators earn AVAX for securing the network</li>
      <li><strong>Burn Mechanism:</strong> All network fees are burned, making AVAX deflationary over time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. 👥 Team & Backers</h3>
    <p>Avalanche was founded by Emin Gün Sirer, a renowned computer scientist and professor at Cornell University. Ava Labs leads development. The project is backed by major investors including a16z, Polychain Capital, Three Arrows Capital (early), and Galaxy Digital.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌐 Ecosystem & Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DeFi:</strong> Trader Joe, Pangolin, BENQI, Yield Yak</li>
      <li><strong>GameFi:</strong> Shrapnel, Crabada</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise & Institutions:</strong> Deloitte partnership for document verification</li>
      <li><strong>Subnets:</strong> Custom blockchains like DeFi Kingdoms and others use Avalanche subnets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. 📈 Market Performance</h3>
    <p>AVAX reached an all-time high of ~$146 in late 2021. It has experienced volatility in line with broader market trends. Despite pullbacks, Avalanche remains among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap and has retained developer interest through subnet innovation.</p>

    <h3>7. 🛣️ Roadmap & Recent Developments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evergreen Subnets:</strong> Tailored for enterprise and institutional use</li>
      <li><strong>Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM):</strong> Native messaging between subnets</li>
      <li><strong>Tokenized Assets:</strong> Initiatives like Intain and partnerships with financial institutions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. 🛒 How to Buy & Store AVAX</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy:</strong> Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, Gate.io</li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Core Wallet (official), MetaMask (for C-Chain), Ledger, Trust Wallet</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. ⚠️ Risks & Criticisms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High competition with other Layer 1s (Solana, Ethereum, etc.)</li>
      <li>Early criticisms of centralization around validator requirements</li>
      <li>Some subnets still under development with limited adoption</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. 🧠 Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Avalanche stands out for its unique tri-chain design and innovative subnet architecture, enabling developers to build tailored blockchain ecosystems. Its scalability, quick finality, and deflationary model make it a serious contender in the multi-chain future. As adoption of subnets and institutional use grows, Avalanche could see a strong resurgence.</p>
