    <h2>Bitcoin Runes - Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>1. 🔍 Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Runes is a fungible token protocol built directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. It was introduced by Casey Rodarmor (creator of Ordinals) and officially launched during the Bitcoin Halving in April 2024. Runes allows for the creation, transfer, and trading of fungible tokens (like meme coins or utility tokens) on Bitcoin using a UTXO-based design, without requiring off-chain indexing.</p>

    <h3>2. ⚙️ Core Technology & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>UTXO-Native:</strong> Built entirely using Bitcoin’s native Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model</li>
      <li><strong>On-Chain Simplicity:</strong> No need for off-chain indexers, making it more secure and censorship-resistant</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient:</strong> Designed to minimize blockchain bloat and promote clean UTXO management</li>
      <li><strong>Ordinal-Compatible:</strong> Inspired by the success of Ordinals (NFTs on Bitcoin), but designed for fungible tokens</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. 📊 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Runes is a protocol for creating fungible tokens, not a token itself</li>
      <li><strong>Token Launches:</strong> Anyone can mint their own Runes-based tokens (like meme coins or game tokens)</li>
      <li><strong>Popular Tokens:</strong> $DOG, $PUPS, and many meme tokens were among the first to launch on Runes</li>
      <li><strong>Scarcity & Ownership:</strong> Tokens are limited by mint rules encoded into Bitcoin transactions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. 👥 Team & Backers</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Runes was developed by <strong>Casey Rodarmor</strong>, the creator of Ordinals. There was no VC funding or large centralized team. The project emerged from the open-source Bitcoin builder community, with significant support from Bitcoin purists and Ordinals enthusiasts.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌐 Ecosystem & Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meme Coins:</strong> Runes enabled a wave of meme coin launches on Bitcoin (similar to Solana and Ethereum)</li>
      <li><strong>On-Chain Assets:</strong> Allows on-chain loyalty points, community tokens, and game tokens</li>
      <li><strong>Marketplaces:</strong> Ecosystem tools like <a href="https://runealpha.xyz" target="_blank">Rune Alpha</a> and <a href="https://magiceden.io" target="_blank">Magic Eden</a> support Runes trading</li>
      <li><strong>Bridges & Wallets:</strong> Support growing across wallets like Xverse, UniSat, and OKX</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. 📈 Market Performance</h3>
    <p>The Runes protocol quickly gained traction after launch, with hundreds of tokens and tens of millions in trading volume. Some meme tokens reached market caps over $100M within days. Volatility remains extremely high, and many tokens are experimental or community-led.</p>

    <h3>7. 🛣️ Roadmap & Recent Developments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Launch:</strong> Went live on April 20, 2024 (Bitcoin Halving day)</li>
      <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> Wallet and explorer integrations are expanding rapidly</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> Potential integration with Bitcoin L2s (e.g., Stacks, BitVM) in the future</li>
      <li><strong>Community Growth:</strong> Large meme coin communities migrating from Solana and Base to Bitcoin</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. 🛒 How to Buy & Store Runes Tokens</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy:</strong> Trade Runes tokens on <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals" target="_blank">Magic Eden</a> (Ordinals section) or <a href="https://runealpha.xyz" target="_blank">RuneAlpha</a></li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Use Rune-compatible wallets like Xverse, UniSat, Leather, or OKX Wallet</li>
      <li><strong>Mint:</strong> Some Runes tokens are only available during initial mint phases—follow X updates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. ⚠️ Risks & Criticisms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speculative:</strong> Most Runes tokens are meme-based and carry high risk</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Still early—wallet support, tooling, and education are developing</li>
      <li><strong>No Regulation:</strong> Like most Bitcoin-native innovations, Runes operate without KYC or investor protections</li>
      <li><strong>Chain Bloat:</strong> Critics argue Runes and Ordinals increase transaction load on Bitcoin</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. 🧠 Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin Runes represent a bold experiment in bringing fungible tokens to Bitcoin without changing its core design. It empowers Bitcoin to host meme coins, DeFi primitives, and community assets—without relying on external smart contracts. As the tooling matures, Runes could become a defining part of Bitcoin’s cultural and technical evolution.</p>
