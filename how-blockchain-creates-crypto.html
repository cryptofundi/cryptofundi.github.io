    <h2>How Blockchain Creates Crypto</h2>

    <p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are **born through a blockchain process** — not printed like paper money. Here's how it works:</p>

    <h3>1. Blockchain = Digital Ledger</h3>
    <p>Imagine a huge notebook where everyone can write, but no one can erase. This notebook keeps records of who owns what — that's the blockchain.</p>

    <h3>2. Crypto Comes from Block Rewards</h3>
    <p>When someone helps maintain this notebook (by validating and adding blocks), the blockchain rewards them with new crypto. This is how new coins are created.</p>

    <h3>Example: Bitcoin</h3>
    <p>Every time a miner successfully adds a block to the Bitcoin blockchain, they get rewarded with new BTC. That’s freshly created Bitcoin — not taken from anyone else.</p>

    <h3>Analogy</h3>
    <p>Think of the blockchain as a factory. When someone helps run the factory efficiently, the system rewards them with a new token — like a digital paycheck.</p>

    <h3>3. Minting in Proof-of-Stake</h3>
    <p>In newer systems like Ethereum (post-merge), coins are created through <strong>staking</strong> instead of mining. Validators are randomly selected to propose new blocks and are rewarded with new crypto.</p>

    <h3>So, Who Controls It?</h3>
    <p>No one central bank. It's all automatic — controlled by code and verified by users around the world. This makes crypto <strong>decentralized and transparent</strong>.</p>

    <p>In short: <strong>Crypto is created as a reward for maintaining and securing the blockchain network.</strong></p>
