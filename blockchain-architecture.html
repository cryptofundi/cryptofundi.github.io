    <h2>Blockchain Architecture</h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Advanced Topics</p>
    <p>
      Blockchain architecture refers to the underlying design and components that make a blockchain network function. It ensures transparency, decentralization, security, and immutability. Here's a simplified breakdown:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Blocks</h3>
    <p>Each block contains a batch of transactions. Think of a block like a page in a record book — once it's written, it can’t be altered.</p>

    <h3>2. Chain of Blocks</h3>
    <p>Blocks are linked together in chronological order using cryptographic hashes. This is what makes it a “chain.” Changing one block would break the whole chain.</p>

    <h3>3. Nodes</h3>
    <p>These are individual computers that participate in the blockchain network. Each node holds a copy of the entire blockchain and verifies transactions.</p>

    <h3>4. Consensus Mechanism</h3>
    <p>This is the protocol used by nodes to agree on the current state of the blockchain. Examples include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and more.</p>

    <h3>5. Smart Contracts (Optional)</h3>
    <p>In blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on-chain. They automate actions when conditions are met.</p>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a public Google Doc that anyone can view. Every time a new line is added (a transaction), all viewers (nodes) see it in real-time. No one can erase the old lines — that’s blockchain!
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Blockchain architecture is the blueprint that enables decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. Whether for digital money, smart contracts, or NFTs — it's the structure behind it all.
