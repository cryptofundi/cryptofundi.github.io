    <h2>Real-World Use Cases of Blockchain</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain is more than just crypto. It's already transforming industries beyond finance. Let’s explore some real-world applications that show how blockchain is solving real problems.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Cross-Border Payments</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional international transfers take days and charge high fees. Blockchain enables near-instant, low-cost global money transfers using cryptocurrencies like XRP and stablecoins like USDC.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Supply Chain Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      Companies like IBM and Walmart use blockchain to track the journey of goods — from farm to store — ensuring quality, safety, and transparency for consumers.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Identity Verification</h3>
    <p>
      Blockchain allows people to control and verify their digital identities securely without relying on centralized databases prone to hacks.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Voting Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting using blockchain could eliminate election fraud and improve public trust in electoral systems.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Healthcare Records</h3>
    <p>
      Patients can control access to their medical records on a blockchain, reducing errors and improving data security across hospitals and clinics.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Real Estate</h3>
    <p>
      Property sales and land records can be recorded on blockchain, reducing paperwork, preventing fraud, and making ownership transfers faster and cheaper.
    </p>

    <h3>7. NFTs in Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
      Artists and musicians use NFTs to sell digital art or music directly to fans, cutting out middlemen and ensuring creators get paid fairly.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Think of blockchain as a super transparent, unchangeable public notebook. Once something is written, everyone sees it and no one can erase it — that's why it's trusted for critical data.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Blockchain technology is still evolving, but its real-world use cases are growing rapidly — and they’re making industries more secure, efficient, and fair.
