    <h2>NFT Utility and Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
      NFTs aren’t just about pixel art or collectibles. They have real-world utility and a growing number of use cases in digital and physical ecosystems.
    </p>

    <h3>🎨 1. Digital Art and Collectibles</h3>
    <p>
      The most common NFT use case. Artists can sell their work globally and earn royalties every time it’s resold.
    </p>

    <h3>🎮 2. Gaming Assets</h3>
    <p>
      NFTs power in-game items, skins, and characters that players can truly own and trade. Popular in Web3 games like Axie Infinity and Illuvium.
    </p>

    <h3>💳 3. Memberships & Access Passes</h3>
    <p>
      NFTs can act like digital keys to exclusive clubs, Discord servers, private content, or even in-person events. Example: PROOF Collective or VeeFriends.
    </p>

    <h3>📄 4. Identity and Certificates</h3>
    <p>
      NFTs can store verifiable academic certificates, identity credentials, and professional achievements on-chain.
    </p>

    <h3>🎟️ 5. Ticketing</h3>
    <p>
      Event tickets as NFTs prevent fraud and enable resale royalties for event organizers. Blockchain verifies authenticity.
    </p>

    <h3>🏠 6. Real Estate & Asset Ownership</h3>
    <p>
      Some platforms tokenize ownership of real estate or physical goods using NFTs, allowing for fractional ownership or digital proof of property.
    </p>

    <h3>🛍️ 7. Brand Loyalty & Digital Merch</h3>
    <p>
      Brands use NFTs for customer loyalty programs and exclusive digital merchandise. Examples include Starbucks Odyssey and Nike’s .SWOOSH platform.
    </p>

    <h3>🧠 8. Intellectual Property (IP)</h3>
    <p>
      Owning an NFT can give you commercial rights to a character, brand, or concept — like Bored Apes used in merch, cartoons, and more.
    </p>

    <h3>🚀 Future Outlook</h3>
    <p>
      As Web3 grows, NFT utility will extend further — into education, healthcare, supply chain tracking, and decentralized social platforms.
