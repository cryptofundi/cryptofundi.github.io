    <h2>üî• $ASH ‚Äî The Transparency Demo Token</h2>

    <p><strong>$ASH</strong> is an <strong>educational on-chain demo</strong> created by Crypto Fundi to demonstrate how <em>token burns, transparent airdrops, and decentralization</em> work in practice. Born in fire. Burned to purity. Distributed to everyone. This project is <strong>not</strong> an investment, has no monetary value, and is only for learning purposes.</p>

    <h3>üöÄ Why We Created $ASH</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To show beginners how token creation and burns work on Base (or any EVM-compatible chain).</li>
      <li>To demonstrate transparent airdrops and decentralized ownership in a live, verifiable way.</li>
      <li>To provide a real on-chain example students can inspect, verify, and learn from.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîë Key Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> ASH Token</li>
      <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> ASH</li>
      <li><strong>Chain:</strong> Base (EVM compatible)</li>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 2,100,000,000</li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> Demo / Educational Only (Not for trading or investment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üî• The Great Burn & Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Burn:</strong> 99% of total supply (2,079,000,000) ‚Äî permanently sent to burn address (e.g. <code>0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD</code>).</li>
      <li><strong>Remaining after first burn:</strong> 21,000,000 ASH.</li>
      <li><strong>Airdrop:</strong> 99% of the remaining 21,000,000 (‚âà20,790,000 ASH) will be airdropped to participants (likes/RTs + Base wallet in comments).</li>
      <li><strong>Creator Reserve:</strong> 0.01% of total supply (210,000 ASH) will remain in a public demo reserve wallet for future educational demos. This reserve will <strong>not</strong> be used for speculation and will be publicly viewable.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> <em>None added by creator.</em> Any liquidity added later is community-driven and not endorsed by Crypto Fundi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üìú FAQ ‚Äî Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Q: Does $ASH have any monetary value?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: No. $ASH is purely educational. It is not an investment, does not represent equity, and has no guaranteed value.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Q: Why should I participate in the airdrop if there is no liquidity?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: $ASH is a living lesson. Holding $ASH is a proof of participation in a transparency experiment ‚Äî an on-chain badge that shows you were part of the Great Burn. It also gives you early access to future educational demos from Crypto Fundi.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Q: What happens if someone adds liquidity?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: Anyone can add liquidity; if they do, that action is independent and community-driven. Crypto Fundi will not add liquidity or promote trading. The project remains educational.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Q: How will the airdrop be executed?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: Airdrops will be performed from a dedicated public airdrop wallet. All airdrop transactions will be posted with TX hashes for verification. Participants must comment their Base wallet address under the official X post and like/RT the thread to be eligible.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Q: Can I trade or sell my ASH?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: Not initially ‚Äî the creator will not add liquidity. If community members create a liquidity pool later, trading may become possible, but that is not part of the official demo plan.</dd>

      $1The creator holds a tiny public reserve (0.01% ‚Äî approx. 210,000 ASH) for future **educational demonstrations only**. This reserve is intended to be used solely for teaching purposes (for example, to demonstrate swaps, liquidity, or gas costs) and not for profit-taking.

If community members later add liquidity and the token acquires market value, a **small, clearly documented portion** of the reserve may be used to offset demo-related costs or to run practical classroom demonstrations. Any such movements will be fully public and verifiable on-chain ‚Äî all transactions from the reserve wallet will be posted with TX hashes and an explanation of purpose.

Under no circumstances will the reserve be used for speculative sales or undisclosed profit-taking. The creator will always prioritize transparency and education in any use of the reserve.$2

      <dt><strong>Q: Is $ASH affiliated with other tokens named ASH?</strong></dt>
      <dd>A: No. Token names and symbols can be reused. What makes this token unique is its <em>contract address</em> on Base. Always verify the contract address before interacting with any token.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>üß± Transparency & Commitments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All transactions (burns, airdrops) will be publicly verifiable on BaseScan/Etherscan.</li>
      <li>No presale, no fundraising, no roadmap ‚Äî this is an educational experiment only.</li>
      <li>The creator reserve wallet address will be published and visible on-chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üéØ Future Educational Uses</h3>
    <p>We may use $ASH and the demo reserve to demonstrate additional concepts in future lessons, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How liquidity pools work (using a tiny demo pool if needed)</li>
      <li>How airdrops and batch transfers operate (with gas and costs explained)</li>
      <li>How token explorers and on-chain verification work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üìú Disclaimer</h3>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> $ASH is a demonstration token created for educational purposes. It is not an investment or financial product. Crypto Fundi does not guarantee any value and is not responsible for any third-party actions such as community-created liquidity pools.</p>
