    <h2>🔥 $ASH — The Transparency Demo Token</h2>

    <p><strong>$ASH</strong> is an <strong>educational on-chain demo</strong> created by Crypto Fundi to demonstrate how <em>token burns, transparent airdrops, and decentralization</em> work in practice. Born in fire. Burned to purity. Distributed to everyone. This project is <strong>not</strong> an investment, has no monetary value, and is only for learning purposes.</p>

    <h3>🚀 Why We Created $ASH</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To show beginners how token creation and burns work on Base (or any EVM-compatible chain).</li>
      <li>To demonstrate transparent airdrops and decentralized ownership in a live, verifiable way.</li>
      <li>To provide a real on-chain example students can inspect, verify, and learn from.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔑 Key Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> ASH</li>
      <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> ASH</li>
      <li><strong>Chain:</strong> Base (EVM compatible)</li>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 2,100,000,000</li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> Demo / Educational Only (Not for trading or investment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔥 The Great Burn & Distribution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Burn:</strong> 99% of total supply (2,079,000,000) — permanently sent to burn address (e.g. <code>0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD</code>).</li>
      <li><strong>Remaining after first burn:</strong> 21,000,000 ASH.</li>
      <li><strong>Airdrop:</strong> 99% of the remaining 21,000,000 (≈20,790,000 ASH) will be airdropped to participants (likes/RTs + Base wallet in comments).</li>
      <li><strong>Creator Reserve:</strong> 0.01% of total supply (210,000 ASH) will remain in a public demo reserve wallet for future educational demos. This reserve will <strong>not</strong> be used for speculation and will be publicly viewable.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> <em>None added by creator.</em> Any liquidity added later is community-driven and not endorsed by Crypto Fundi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📜 FAQ — Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Q: What is $ASH?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: $ASH is a fully decentralized, educational demo token — created to illustrate how transparency, burning, and fair airdrops work on-chain. 99% of the supply was permanently burned, and the remaining 1% is used for symbolic airdrops and demos by <strong>Crypto Fundi</strong>.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: Does $ASH have any monetary value?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: No. $ASH is purely educational. It is not an investment, does not represent equity, and has no guaranteed or implied value.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: Why should I participate in the airdrop if there is no liquidity?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: $ASH is a living lesson in transparency. Holding $ASH is proof of participation in an on-chain experiment — a symbolic badge showing you were part of the Great Burn. It also grants early access to future transparency demos and learning projects by <strong>Crypto Fundi</strong>.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: What happens if someone adds liquidity?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: Anyone can add liquidity voluntarily. If that happens, it’s a completely community-driven action. The creator will not add liquidity or promote trading. This project remains an educational demonstration, not a trading initiative.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: How will the airdrop be executed?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: Airdrops will be performed from a dedicated public airdrop wallet. All transactions will be published with TX hashes for verification. Participants must <strong>Like</strong> + <strong>Repost</strong> the official X post and <strong>comment their Base wallet address</strong> to be eligible. Each eligible wallet will receive <strong>99 tokens</strong> as a symbolic distribution.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: Can I comment multiple wallet addresses?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: Each wallet address is treated as a unique participant. If the same person comments multiple wallets, each address is considered separately. This demonstrates how wallet-level fairness works in open, decentralized systems — without identity-based filtering.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: When will the airdrop be distributed?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: The airdrop campaign will run for <strong>60 days</strong> from launch or until <strong>210,000 unique wallets</strong> have received their tokens — whichever comes first. If any tokens remain afterward, they will be sent to verified Base ecosystem projects and community addresses to maintain broad, decentralized distribution.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: Can I trade or sell my ASH?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: Not initially. The creator will not add liquidity. If community members create a liquidity pool later, trading may become possible, but that is outside the official demo scope.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: What is the creator’s reserve?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: The creator holds a small public reserve (0.01% ≈ 210,000 ASH) for <strong>educational demonstrations only</strong>. It may be used to illustrate swaps, gas fees, or liquidity concepts — never for undisclosed sales. Any use of the reserve will be <strong>fully transparent</strong>, with on-chain TX hashes and public explanations.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q: Is $ASH affiliated with other tokens named “ASH”?</strong></dt>
  <dd>A: No. Token names and symbols can be reused. What makes this token unique is its <em>contract address</em> on Base. Always verify the correct contract address before interacting with any token.</dd>

    <h3>🧱 Transparency & Commitments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All transactions (burns, airdrops) will be publicly verifiable on BaseScan/Etherscan.</li>
      <li>No presale, no fundraising, no roadmap — this is an educational experiment only.</li>
      <li>The creator reserve wallet address will be published and visible on-chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🎯 Future Educational Uses</h3>
    <p>We may use $ASH and the demo reserve to demonstrate additional concepts in future lessons, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How liquidity pools work (using a tiny demo pool if needed)</li>
      <li>How airdrops and batch transfers operate (with gas and costs explained)</li>
      <li>How token explorers and on-chain verification work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📜 Disclaimer</h3>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> $ASH is a demonstration token created for educational purposes. It is not an investment or financial product. Crypto Fundi does not guarantee any value and is not responsible for any third-party actions such as community-created liquidity pools.</p>
