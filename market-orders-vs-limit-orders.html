    <h2>Market Order vs Limit Order</h2>

    <p>
      When buying or selling crypto on an exchange, you'll usually come across two main types of orders: <strong>Market Orders</strong> and <strong>Limit Orders</strong>. Each serves a different purpose depending on your strategy.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Market Order</h3>
    <p>
      A market order buys or sells immediately at the best available price. It's fast and simple — ideal for beginners or when speed is more important than price.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use case:</strong> You want to buy Bitcoin right now, regardless of the current price.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> You may pay more (or receive less) during sudden price spikes due to slippage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Limit Order</h3>
    <p>
      A limit order lets you set the exact price at which you want to buy or sell. The trade only executes when the market reaches your set price.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use case:</strong> You want to buy Ethereum only if it drops to $2,000. You set a limit order at that price.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> More control over price. You avoid unexpected price movements.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The market may never hit your price, so your order may not execute.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Think of a <strong>market order</strong> like walking into a store and buying an item at whatever price it's listed. A <strong>limit order</strong> is like telling the store, "I'll buy it only if the price drops to $50," and walking away until they call you.
    </p>

    <h3>Which One Should You Use?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market Orders</strong> are better for beginners or urgent trades.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Orders</strong> are best for experienced users, patient traders, or those avoiding volatility.</li>
    </ul>
