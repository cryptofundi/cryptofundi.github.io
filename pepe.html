    <h2>Pepe Coin - Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>1. 🔍 Project Overview</h3>
    <p><strong>Pepe (PEPE)</strong> is a meme coin launched in April 2023 on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the popular internet meme “Pepe the Frog,” PEPE follows in the footsteps of other iconic meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its goal is to be the most memeable meme coin on the market, and it has no inherent utility, roadmap, or team promises—just pure meme culture and viral hype.</p>

    <h3>2. ⚙️ Core Technology & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum</li>
      <li><strong>Token Contract:</strong> Simple and verified contract with no tax, no rebase, and renounced ownership</li>
      <li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> No official development team or roadmap—completely driven by social media and meme trends</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized Launch:</strong> 100% of supply launched directly to the public</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. 📊 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 420,690,000,000,000 PEPE</li>
      <li><strong>Burned Tokens:</strong> Over 6% of the supply was burned</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> 93.1% of the supply sent to Uniswap and LP tokens burned</li>
      <li><strong>No Taxes:</strong> 0% buy/sell tax</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. 👥 Team & Backers</h3>
    <p>Pepe was launched anonymously, similar to other meme coin projects. There’s no known team or official development group. The token’s growth has come entirely from community marketing and virality. Its early adopters and meme influencers helped it gain traction and listings on major exchanges.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌐 Ecosystem & Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Culture Coin:</strong> Aims to be a symbol of meme culture within crypto</li>
      <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Primarily traded as a speculative asset, with no core utility or ecosystem</li>
      <li><strong>Listings:</strong> PEPE has been listed on major centralized exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and OKX</li>
      <li><strong>Community Projects:</strong> Some third-party tools and NFTs have been launched around PEPE</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. 📈 Market Performance</h3>
    <p>PEPE saw explosive growth in its first month, reaching a multibillion-dollar market cap and making early adopters massive profits. While the price has experienced volatility since, it remains one of the top meme coins by market cap. It demonstrated how viral, community-driven narratives can rival projects with deep tech.</p>

    <h3>7. 🛣️ Roadmap & Recent Developments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Roadmap:</strong> The project has no official roadmap or development plan</li>
      <li><strong>Organic Growth:</strong> Memes, influencer support, and exchange listings continue to drive interest</li>
      <li><strong>Community Events:</strong> PEPE-branded NFTs, burn events, and community initiatives occasionally trend on X</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. 🛒 How to Buy & Store Pepe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy:</strong> Available on Uniswap (ETH pair), Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, and other major exchanges</li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Store PEPE in any ERC-20 compatible wallet such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Ledger</li>
      <li><strong>DEX Tips:</strong> When using Uniswap, set slippage tolerance to 1-2% for smooth execution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. ⚠️ Risks & Criticisms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Utility:</strong> PEPE has no product, roadmap, or tech value—it's purely memetic</li>
      <li><strong>Volatile:</strong> Prices are driven by hype and sentiment; sudden pumps and dumps are common</li>
      <li><strong>Copycats:</strong> Many knock-off meme coins launched after PEPE’s success, increasing scam risk</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Unknowns:</strong> As with other meme coins, PEPE may attract future scrutiny due to its viral nature and centralized exchange exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. 🧠 Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Pepe Coin is the latest example of meme culture shaping the crypto landscape. It thrives on virality and has succeeded in capturing the attention of millions with zero traditional fundamentals. While it offers little in terms of technology or utility, PEPE has proven the power of community-driven narratives—and reminded everyone that sometimes, crypto is just about the memes.</p>
