    <h2>Blockchain vs Traditional Banking</h2>
    <p>
      Both banks and blockchains help us store and move money, but they operate in very different ways. Understanding the difference helps you see the power of decentralized finance.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Control</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Banks:</strong> Controlled by governments and institutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Decentralized — no single authority controls it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Accessibility</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Banks:</strong> Require identity verification, may not be available in all countries.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Open to anyone with internet — global and inclusive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Operating Hours</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Banks:</strong> Operate only during business hours, closed on weekends/holidays.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> 24/7/365 — always on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Transaction Speed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Banks:</strong> May take hours or days (especially international transfers).</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Seconds to minutes, regardless of location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Fees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Banks:</strong> May charge high fees for transfers, maintenance, and conversions.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Fees vary by network but often lower, especially for global transfers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional banking is like using a post office to send a letter. Blockchain is like sending a message instantly via email. Both work — but one is faster, cheaper, and globally accessible.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      While banks remain essential in today’s economy, blockchain offers a revolutionary alternative — one that puts power in the hands of individuals, not institutions.
