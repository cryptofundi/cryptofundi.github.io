    <h2>Understanding Liquidity</h2>

    <p>
      Liquidity in crypto refers to how easily you can buy or sell a cryptocurrency without affecting its price. High liquidity means there are many buyers and sellers, so trades happen quickly and at stable prices. Low liquidity can lead to delays and price slippage.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Liquidity Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster Trades:</strong> More liquidity = quicker order execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Better Prices:</strong> You get the price you see with less slippage.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Risk:</strong> High liquidity reduces the impact of sudden price swings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you're trying to sell a bottle of water:
      <br>
      In a crowded stadium (high liquidity), you'll sell it in seconds at your asking price.  
      <br>
      In a remote village (low liquidity), you might wait hours or sell it for less than you wanted.
    </p>

    <h3>Factors That Affect Liquidity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trading Volume:</strong> Higher volume means more activity and better liquidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange Listing:</strong> Coins listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase usually have more liquidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Trust:</strong> Popular and trusted projects attract more trading.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Centralized vs Decentralized Liquidity</h3>
    <p>
      - <strong>Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):</strong> Provide deep liquidity through order books.<br>
      - <strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):</strong> Use liquidity pools. Liquidity depends on how much crypto is locked by users.
