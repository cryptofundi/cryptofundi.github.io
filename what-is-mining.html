    <h2>What is Mining?</h2>

    <p><strong>Crypto mining</strong> is the process of using computers to secure a blockchain and validate transactions. In return, miners earn rewards — usually in the form of new coins like Bitcoin.</p>

    <h3>🔧 How It Works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Miners use powerful computers to solve complex math problems.</li>
      <li>The first to solve the problem gets to add a block of transactions to the blockchain.</li>
      <li>They are rewarded with cryptocurrency (e.g., 6.25 BTC for Bitcoin block).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔒 Why It Matters:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mining keeps the blockchain secure and decentralized.</li>
      <li>No need for a central authority like a bank.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy:</h3>
    <p>Think of miners like referees in a football match — they make sure rules are followed. But instead of getting a salary, they compete to get paid by solving a puzzle.</p>

    <h3>⛏️ Types of Mining:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Used by Bitcoin. Requires electricity & computing power.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> No mining — validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. (Used by Ethereum now)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, mining is done in huge data centers, especially in countries with cheap electricity. But it's how Bitcoin and other major cryptos were born and secured.</p>
