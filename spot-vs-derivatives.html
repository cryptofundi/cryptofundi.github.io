    <h2>Spot vs Derivatives Trading</h2>

    <p>In the crypto world, you’ll often hear about “spot trading” and “derivatives trading.” These are two different ways to trade cryptocurrencies, and it's important to understand the difference.</p>

    <h3>💰 What is Spot Trading?</h3>
    <p>Spot trading is simple. You buy and sell actual crypto assets, and the transaction is settled immediately at the current market price (called the "spot price").</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Buying 1 BTC on Binance at $30,000 — you now actually own that 1 BTC.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Yes, you directly own the crypto.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Lower compared to derivatives, but still depends on market price.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📉 What is Derivatives Trading?</h3>
    <p>In derivatives trading, you don’t buy the actual crypto. Instead, you trade contracts that represent the price movement of crypto. You can profit whether the price goes up or down.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Entering a futures contract to bet on Bitcoin’s price rising — but you never actually hold Bitcoin.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> No, you're only speculating on price.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> High — includes leverage, which can multiply both profits and losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Spot trading is like buying apples at a grocery store — you pay and take the apples home.<br>
      Derivatives trading is like betting on whether the price of apples will rise or fall — without ever owning the apples.
    </p>

    <h3>📌 Which One Should You Use?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New users:</strong> Spot trading is safer and easier to understand.</li>
      <li><strong>Experienced traders:</strong> Derivatives offer more flexibility but come with high risk.</li>
    </ul>
