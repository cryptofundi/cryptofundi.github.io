    <h2>NFT Risks</h2>
    <p>
      NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) offer exciting opportunities, but like any investment or digital asset, they also carry risks that every buyer should understand. Here's a simple breakdown of what you need to watch out for:
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Market Volatility</h3>
    <p>
      NFT prices can swing wildly. What’s worth $10,000 today could be worth $100 tomorrow. The market is speculative, and demand can disappear quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Scams & Rug Pulls</h3>
    <p>
      Many NFT collections promise utility or rewards and vanish after minting. Always research the team behind the project and check if their smart contract is verified.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Fake NFTs & Copyright Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone can mint an NFT, including stolen artwork. Just because it’s on OpenSea or another marketplace doesn’t mean it’s legitimate. Verify the creator or collection.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Platform Dependency</h3>
    <p>
      If the image of your NFT is stored on a centralized server and that server goes down, you could lose access to what your NFT actually displays.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Smart Contract Bugs</h3>
    <p>
      If the NFT smart contract has a bug or exploit, it can be drained or manipulated. Most users can’t read smart contracts, so trust in the dev team is key.
    </p>

    <h3>🔹 Legal & Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
    <p>
      NFTs may face legal scrutiny in some countries, especially if they’re seen as securities. This could affect resale rights or access.
    </p>

    <h3>💡 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Think of NFTs like rare collectibles at a flea market. Some are real treasures, others are knockoffs. Without proper knowledge, you might overpay for something worthless.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ How to Stay Safe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy from verified collections on trusted marketplaces.</li>
      <li>Use wallets with strong security (hardware wallets for high-value NFTs).</li>
      <li>Follow official links—don’t click on random Discord or Twitter links.</li>
      <li>Understand the utility and roadmap (if any) behind the NFT.</li>
    </ul>
