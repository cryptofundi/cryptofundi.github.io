    <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>

    <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> is a special kind of database that records information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to change or hack.</p>

    <p>It works like a <strong>digital ledger</strong> that stores data in "blocks." These blocks are linked together in a chain — hence the name <em>blockchain</em>.</p>

    <h3>🔗 Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> No single person, company, or government controls it. It’s managed by many computers across the world.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Everyone on the network can see the transactions. This builds trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Once data is added to a blockchain, it’s extremely hard to change. This prevents fraud and tampering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Imagine a notebook that everyone in the world can write in, but once something is written, it can’t be erased. Everyone has a copy, and every update is checked by the group before it’s added. That’s how blockchain works.</p>

    <p>Blockchain is the core technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum — but it’s also being used in supply chains, voting systems, and digital identity.</p>
