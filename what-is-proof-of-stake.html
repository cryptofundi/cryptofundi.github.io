    <h2>What is Proof of Stake?</h2>

    <p><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong> is a modern consensus mechanism used in many cryptocurrencies to validate transactions and secure the blockchain — without needing energy-hungry mining.</p>

    <h3>🔍 How It Works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of miners, there are validators.</li>
      <li>Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of crypto they “stake” (lock up as collateral).</li>
      <li>The more crypto you stake, the higher your chances of being selected to validate and earn rewards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌱 Why It Matters:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eco-friendly — uses a fraction of the energy required by Proof of Work.</li>
      <li>Faster and more scalable than PoW systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🪙 Examples of PoS Cryptocurrencies:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> — Switched from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong> — Built entirely on a PoS system.</li>
      <li><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong> — Uses a hybrid Proof of Stake and Proof of History model.</li>
      <li><strong>Polkadot (DOT)</strong> and <strong>Tezos (XTZ)</strong> are also notable PoS-based coins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy:</h3>
    <p>Imagine a lottery where the more tickets you own (the more crypto you stake), the higher your chance of being chosen to validate the next block — and get a reward.</p>

    <h3>⚠️ Risks:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If validators act dishonestly, they can lose some or all of their staked crypto (called slashing).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Proof of Stake offers a sustainable and scalable future for crypto — it’s quickly becoming the preferred system for new blockchains.</p>
