    <h2>Nodes in Blockchain</h2>
    <p>In the world of blockchain, a <strong>node</strong> is any computer that connects to the blockchain network. Nodes help maintain the security and accuracy of the blockchain by validating, storing, and broadcasting transactions and blocks.</p>

    <h3>Types of Nodes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full Node:</strong> Stores the entire blockchain ledger and validates all transactions and blocks independently. These nodes enforce the rules of the blockchain.</li>
      <li><strong>Light Node (SPV Node):</strong> Stores only the block headers, not the full data. Used in mobile wallets to reduce resource usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Mining Node:</strong> A full node that also tries to create new blocks by solving complex puzzles (Proof of Work).</li>
      <li><strong>Validator Node:</strong> In Proof of Stake systems, these nodes are responsible for verifying and proposing new blocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Nodes Matter</h3>
    <p>Nodes keep the blockchain decentralized and secure. More nodes mean higher resistance to attacks or data loss. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain, so if one node goes offline, the data isn't lost.</p>

    <h3>Analogy</h3>
    <p>Think of nodes as librarians in a giant global library. Every librarian has a copy of the books (blockchain), and they all agree on what’s in each book (validation). If one librarian makes a mistake, the others can correct it — ensuring truth and consistency.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Thousands of full nodes running worldwide help secure the network.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Has both full and archive nodes, especially after the shift to Proof of Stake.</li>
      <li><strong>Solana:</strong> Requires high-performance nodes due to its speed and transaction volume.</li>
    </ul>
