    <h2>Gas Fees Explained</h2>

    <p><strong>Gas fees</strong> are like transaction fees you pay to use a blockchain — similar to how you pay a toll to use a highway.</p>

    <h3>Why Do We Pay Gas Fees?</h3>
    <p>Whenever you send crypto, swap tokens, or interact with a smart contract, you're asking the blockchain network to process your request. That takes computational power, and the fee compensates the network validators or miners for doing the work.</p>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Think of gas fees like delivery charges when you order food online. The more complex the order (like a big smart contract), or the more traffic on the platform, the higher the fee.</p>

    <h3>Gas Fee Comparison</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong> Varies by network congestion. Average fees can range from $0.50 to $5+. Slow and expensive for small transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> Known for high fees during peak times. Swapping tokens can cost $10–$50+ if the network is busy.</li>
      <li><strong>Solana (SOL):</strong> Extremely low gas fees — typically less than $0.01. Ideal for high-speed, low-cost transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Base (L2 on Ethereum):</strong> Built to lower Ethereum fees. Costs are typically under $0.10 even during busy times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Factors That Affect Gas Fees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Network congestion (more users = higher fees)</li>
      <li>Transaction complexity (simple transfer vs. smart contract interaction)</li>
      <li>Base fee + tip (you can pay more for faster processing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips to Save on Gas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Layer 2 chains like <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>Polygon</strong>, or <strong>Arbitrum</strong></li>
      <li>Transact during low network hours</li>
      <li>Use Solana or other low-fee blockchains for basic transfers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary: <strong>Gas fees are the fuel that powers the blockchain engine. Choosing the right chain can help you save big.</strong></p>
