    <h2>Solana (SOL) - Project Overview</h2>

    <h3>1. 🔍 Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Solana is a high-performance, Layer 1 blockchain designed to support scalable, decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects. Launched in March 2020 by Solana Labs, it’s known for fast transaction speeds and low fees, aiming to become the foundation for mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.</p>

    <h3>2. ⚙️ Core Technology & Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proof of History (PoH):</strong> An innovative timestamping mechanism that improves network efficiency and throughput.</li>
      <li><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong> Through Sealevel, Solana can process thousands of smart contracts in parallel.</li>
      <li><strong>Blazing Fast:</strong> Capable of 65,000+ TPS (transactions per second).</li>
      <li><strong>Low Fees:</strong> Typically <$0.01 per transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. 📊 Tokenomics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ticker:</strong> SOL</li>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> Initially capped at 500 million SOL (with inflationary emissions)</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Starts around 8% and decreases yearly toward ~1.5%</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Network fees, staking, governance (future), ecosystem utility</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. 👥 Team & Backers</h3>
    <p>Solana was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm engineer. The core development is led by Solana Labs. Key backers include Multicoin Capital, a16z, Alameda Research (early), and several other major venture funds.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌐 Ecosystem & Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DeFi:</strong> Jupiter, MarginFi, Orca, Kamino, Drift Protocol</li>
      <li><strong>NFTs:</strong> Tensor, Magic Eden</li>
      <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Star Atlas, Aurory</li>
      <li><strong>Infra & Tooling:</strong> Phantom wallet, Solana Mobile, Solana Pay</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. 📈 Market Performance</h3>
    <p>SOL reached an all-time high of ~$260 in November 2021. Following the 2022 market crash and FTX exposure, it dipped heavily, but saw major recovery in 2023-2024. It remains a top-10 crypto by market cap with strong community support.</p>

    <h3>7. 🛣️ Roadmap & Recent Developments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firedancer:</strong> A new validator client being built by Jump Crypto to improve scalability and resilience.</li>
      <li><strong>Solana Mobile:</strong> Saga phones and mobile dApp store</li>
      <li><strong>Token Extensions:</strong> Enabling more flexible SPL token utilities like transfer hooks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. 🛒 How to Buy & Store SOL</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buy:</strong> Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, Bybit, OKX</li>
      <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Phantom (browser & mobile), Solflare, Backpack, Ledger (via Solana apps)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. ⚠️ Risks & Criticisms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Network outages have occurred multiple times due to congestion bugs</li>
      <li>Previously criticized for centralization (validator concentration)</li>
      <li>Past FTX affiliation affected reputation during 2022 collapse</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. 🧠 Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Solana remains a top contender in the race for scalable blockchain infrastructure. Despite past criticisms and challenges, its developer growth, ecosystem momentum, and constant innovation like Firedancer and Token Extensions signal long-term strength. It’s a fast, cheap chain that is building for real-world usage—especially in DeFi, NFTs, and payments.</p>
