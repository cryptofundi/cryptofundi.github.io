    <h2>Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchains need a way to agree on what transactions are valid. These systems of agreement are called <strong>consensus mechanisms</strong>. Two of the most popular ones are <strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong> and <strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Proof of Work (PoW)</h3>
    <p>
      Used by Bitcoin and some other blockchains. Miners compete to solve complex puzzles using computing power. The first one to solve it gets to validate the transaction and earn a reward.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like a race where many people try to crack a safe. The one who succeeds first wins the prize.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly secure</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> High energy use, slower</p>

    <h3>Proof of Stake (PoS)</h3>
    <p>
      Used by Ethereum (after the Merge), Solana, and others. Validators are chosen based on how many coins they "stake" (lock up as collateral). The more you stake, the more likely you are to validate and earn rewards.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Like a lottery — the more tickets (stake) you hold, the higher your chances of being picked.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Energy efficient, faster</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> May favor wealthier participants</p>

    <h3>Key Differences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PoW:</strong> Competition via computing power</li>
      <li><strong>PoS:</strong> Selection based on staked coins</li>
      <li><strong>PoW:</strong> Energy-intensive</li>
      <li><strong>PoS:</strong> Environmentally friendly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Both aim to keep blockchains secure and decentralized, but PoS is becoming more popular due to lower energy usage and better scalability.
