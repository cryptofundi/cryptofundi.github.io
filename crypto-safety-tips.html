    <h2>Safety Tips for Trading and Storing Crypto</h2>
    
    <p>Crypto offers a powerful and open financial system—but with great freedom comes great responsibility. To stay safe, follow these best practices:</p>

    <h3>1. Use Reputable Wallets and Exchanges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only trade on exchanges with a strong reputation (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Kraken).</li>
      <li>Use non-custodial wallets for long-term storage (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger, Trust Wallet).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always enable 2FA for your exchange accounts and wallet apps.</li>
      <li>Prefer app-based 2FA (like Google Authenticator) over SMS-based codes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Use Cold Storage for Large Holdings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cold wallets (offline devices like Ledger or Trezor) reduce the risk of online hacks.</li>
      <li>Never store your seed phrase online or in the cloud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Avoid Phishing and Scams</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always double-check URLs before entering sensitive info.</li>
      <li>Never click on suspicious links from emails, social media, or DMs.</li>
      <li>Verify official links using project websites or trusted sources like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Backup Your Wallet Securely</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Write down your recovery phrase and store it in a secure, physical location.</li>
      <li>Never share your seed phrase with anyone — no real service will ever ask for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Be Cautious with DApps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use tools like revoke.cash to manage permissions you've granted to DApps.</li>
      <li>Double-check the authenticity of DeFi protocols before interacting with them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Keep Software Updated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Update your wallets, browser extensions, and operating systems regularly to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Consider Using a Hardware Wallet</h3>
    <p>For serious investors or those holding large amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet is the gold standard for secure storage.</p>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy:</h3>
    <p>Think of crypto safety like online banking. You wouldn't give out your bank PIN to a stranger, right? The same applies to your wallet seed phrase. Keep it secret, keep it safe.</p>
