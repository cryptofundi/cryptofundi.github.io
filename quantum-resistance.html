    <h2>Quantum Resistance in Blockchain</h2>
    <p>
      As quantum computing advances, it poses a potential threat to current cryptographic systems — including those used in blockchain. Quantum resistance refers to the development of cryptographic algorithms that can withstand attacks from quantum computers.
    </p>

    <h3>💣 The Quantum Threat</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) and can solve certain mathematical problems — like factoring large numbers — much faster than classical computers. This could break traditional cryptography such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>RSA (used in SSL/TLS)</li>
      <li>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (used in Bitcoin and Ethereum)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔐 What Is Quantum-Resistant Cryptography?</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum-resistant (or post-quantum) cryptography involves designing algorithms that are secure even against quantum attacks. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lattice-based cryptography</li>
      <li>Hash-based signatures</li>
      <li>Multivariate polynomial systems</li>
      <li>Code-based cryptography</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🏗️ Quantum-Resistant Blockchains</h3>
    <p>Some projects are actively researching or implementing quantum-safe tech:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>QANplatform</strong> – Built with post-quantum encryption</li>
      <li><strong>XX Network</strong> – Led by David Chaum, focuses on privacy and quantum safety</li>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin Post-Quantum Proposals</strong> – Discussions exist, but no formal upgrades yet</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🛡️ Should You Worry?</h3>
    <p>
      Most experts agree that large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptography are still years away. However, forward-looking blockchains are already preparing to upgrade their cryptographic methods.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Key Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
      Quantum resistance is a proactive step toward future-proofing blockchain technology. While quantum threats are not immediate, staying ahead is crucial to maintaining trustless security in a decentralized world.
