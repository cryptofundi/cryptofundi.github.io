    <h2>What is a Centralized Exchange (CEX)?</h2>
    <p>
      A Centralized Exchange (CEX) is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies through a central authority or company.
      Popular examples include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a CEX, the exchange acts as an intermediary. You deposit funds into your account on the platform, and they execute trades on your behalf.
      These platforms are usually regulated and offer fiat-to-crypto options.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Beginner-friendly interface</li>
      <li>✅ High liquidity and fast trades</li>
      <li>✅ Customer support and insurance (in some cases)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risks:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ You don’t control your private keys</li>
      <li>❌ Exchange can freeze or lose your funds</li>
      <li>❌ Subject to hacks or regulatory shutdowns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Analogy:</h3>
    <p>
      A centralized exchange is like a traditional bank. You deposit money, and they help you send, receive, or exchange it. But you rely on them to keep it safe and working.
