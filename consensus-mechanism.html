    <h2>Consensus Mechanism</h2>

    <p>A <strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong> is the method a blockchain network uses to agree on the validity of transactions and to maintain a single version of the truth — the blockchain ledger.</p>

    <p>Since there’s no central authority in decentralized systems, consensus ensures that all nodes (computers) in the network agree on which transactions are legitimate.</p>

    <h3>🔑 Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures everyone agrees on the blockchain’s state</li>
      <li>Prevents double-spending and fraud</li>
      <li>Secures the network from manipulation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚙️ Common Types of Consensus Mechanisms</h3>

    <h4>1. Proof of Work (PoW) – Used by Bitcoin</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Miners compete to solve complex puzzles.</li>
      <li>First to solve it adds the new block and earns a reward.</li>
      <li>Very secure but energy-intensive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Proof of Stake (PoS) – Used by Ethereum (post-merge)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Validators are chosen to create blocks based on how much crypto they “stake.”</li>
      <li>Energy-efficient and faster.</li>
      <li>Slashing penalties discourage dishonest behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) – Used by EOS, Tron</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users vote for a few trusted delegates to validate blocks.</li>
      <li>More scalable but more centralized.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Proof of History (PoH) – Used by Solana</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses a timestamping method to order transactions before consensus.</li>
      <li>Extremely fast, suited for high-frequency use cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Nakamoto Consensus – Bitcoin's variant of PoW</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The longest chain (most work) is considered the valid one.</li>
      <li>Named after Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📦 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>Imagine a group project with no teacher. Each member must agree on what gets added to the project (blockchain). If they disagree, nothing moves forward. Consensus mechanisms are like voting systems or game rules that ensure everyone plays fair.</p>

    <h3>🌐 Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consensus = Agreement in a decentralized system</li>
      <li>Different blockchains use different methods based on goals (speed, security, energy use)</li>
      <li>Without consensus, there’s no trust in crypto networks</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The consensus mechanism is the engine that keeps the decentralized world running smoothly and securely.</p>
