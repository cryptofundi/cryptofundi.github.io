    <h2>Trading vs Investing in Crypto</h2>

    <p>
      Both trading and investing are ways to make money with crypto — but they are very different in approach, time commitment, and risk.
    </p>

    <h3>🔁 What is Crypto Trading?</h3>
    <p>
      Trading is like trying to make quick profits by buying low and selling high over short timeframes — minutes, hours, or days.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Short-term gains</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Requires regular monitoring and fast decisions</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Charts, technical analysis, stop-losses</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Higher, especially in volatile markets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📈 What is Crypto Investing?</h3>
    <p>
      Investing means buying a cryptocurrency and holding it for a long time — months or years — believing it will grow in value.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Long-term wealth building</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> Passive, with occasional check-ins</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Fundamental research, whitepapers, trends</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Lower compared to trading, but still present</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy</h3>
    <p>
      Trading is like day-to-day buying and selling of vegetables in a market — quick moves and fast decisions.<br>
      Investing is like planting a fruit tree — it takes time to grow, but the rewards come over time.
    </p>

    <h3>So, Which One Is Better?</h3>
    <p>
      It depends on your risk appetite, time availability, and goals:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> Often better to start with investing</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Users:</strong> Can explore trading with proper education and tools</li>
      </ul>
