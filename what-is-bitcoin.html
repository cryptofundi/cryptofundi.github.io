    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is the world’s first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows people to send and receive money over the internet without needing a bank or middleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It runs on a decentralized network called the blockchain, which acts like a public ledger. Every transaction is recorded and cannot be changed, making it secure and transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional currencies like the dollar or euro, Bitcoin is not printed. Instead, it’s “mined” by computers solving complex puzzles to verify transactions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> Think of Bitcoin as digital gold. Just like gold is mined and has a limited supply, only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. This limited supply gives Bitcoin its value.</p>
    <p>
      People use Bitcoin for various reasons — investing, sending money internationally, or simply to have control over their own money outside of banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is often the entry point into the world of crypto. If you understand Bitcoin, you're already halfway to understanding the rest of the crypto space.
