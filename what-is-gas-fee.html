    <h2>What is Gas Fee?</h2>

    <p>In the world of cryptocurrency, a <strong>Gas Fee</strong> is the cost of performing a transaction or executing a smart contract on a blockchain network — especially on Ethereum.</p>

    <h3>⛽ Why Is It Called “Gas”?</h3>
    <p>Just like a car needs gas to move, a blockchain needs “gas” to process your transaction. You’re paying to use the network’s computing power.</p>

    <h3>💸 How It Works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each action on a blockchain — sending crypto, minting NFTs, using DeFi — consumes computational resources.</li>
      <li>You pay a gas fee in the blockchain’s native currency (e.g., ETH for Ethereum).</li>
      <li>Gas prices vary based on how busy the network is (supply and demand).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Gas Fees Can Fluctuate</h3>
    <p>During times of high traffic, like popular NFT drops or token launches, gas fees can become very expensive.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Real-World Analogy:</h3>
    <p>Think of it like a toll road. The more traffic there is, the higher the toll — and the faster you want to go, the more you pay.</p>

    <h3>📉 Ways to Reduce Gas Fees:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the network during off-peak hours.</li>
      <li>Use Layer 2 solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, or Polygon).</li>
      <li>Some newer chains like Solana or Avalanche have much lower fees.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding gas fees is key to managing your crypto costs and making smarter transactions.</p>
